  Approach
  Using bitwise "XOR" and "AND" operations to perform operation. "XOR" and "AND" operation produce the sum and carry of the binary addition respectively.
  a XOR b (a ^ b): form bitwise sum of a+b w/o carry
  a AND b (a & b): form bitwise carry of a+b
  a + b = a XOR b + ((a AND b) << 1)
